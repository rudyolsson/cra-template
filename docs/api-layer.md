# ðŸ“¡ API Layer

### Use a single instance of the API client

A single instance of the API client that's been pre-configured and reused throughout the application. E.g have a single API client ([axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) / [graphql-request](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-request) / [apollo-client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)) instance with pre-defined configuration.
